# Cache Memory Assignment
## CSCI 340 - Operating Systems
## Assignment 5
### By Dan Johnson & Brett Widholm

This assignment is designed to answer the following 4 questions through _experimentation_:

1. How big is a cache block for the current system?
2. How big is the cache in total?
3. What is the duration of an access to main memory?
4. What is the duration of an access to cache memory?

The language used is C, so we'll create all `.h` and `.c` files, along with `README.txt` (which will be created using `cat README.md > README.txt`), and the `Makefile`
